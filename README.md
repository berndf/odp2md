# ODP2pandoc

This tool tries to extract relevant data from ODP files and converts it to pandoc Markdown targeting reveal.js and Beamer. It was developed to rescue all my data which resides in huge piles of slide decks. 

## ToDo

- [ ] Normalize text output, which needs to remove trailing spaces which are generated by the hierarchy level
- [ ] detect formulas and convert them into proper pandoc Math/inline Math format
- [ ] detect WMF or other obscure formats and use imagemagick or ffmpeg to convert them
- [ ] rename media files with a derivative of the slide title
