# ODP2pandoc

This tool extracts relevant data from ODP files and converts it to [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) Markdown targeting conversion to reveal.js and Beamer. It was developed to rescue all my lectures, which resided in huge piles of slide decks made in PowerPoint and LibreOffice. Many times I had to reboot my system just to keep going on with the lecture - this led me think of moving to a method that keeps content and presentation separate.  

## ToDo

- [ ] Normalize text output, which needs to remove trailing spaces which are generated by the hierarchy level
- [ ] detect formulas and convert them into proper pandoc Math/inline Math format
- [ ] detect WMF or other obscure formats and use imagemagick or ffmpeg to convert them
- [ ] rename media files with a derivative of the slide title
